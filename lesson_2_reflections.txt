Reflect: Initializing a Repository

Now that you've initialized your first repository, go to your
reflections directory, create a new file called
lesson_2_reflections.txt, and add the following question and your
thoughts on it:

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do
it?

Reflect: Staging Area

Now that you've added a file to the staging area (or maybe multiple
files!), go add the following question and your thoughts on it to your
lesson_2_reflections file:

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?


Reflect: Commit Size

Now that you've committed changes using the staging area, go add the
following question and your thoughts on it to your
lesson_2_reflections file:

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

You may also want to commit your changes to the file. When you're
ready to move on, click "Next" and Sarah will go over a concept called
branching.

Reflect: When to Use Branches

Now that you've learned how to create a branch in Git, go add the
following question and your thoughts on it to your reflections file:

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping
your history organised? How would branches help?
